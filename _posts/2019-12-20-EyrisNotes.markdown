When you are on a path to becoming financially independent and stable with a sustainable business, it is often hard to keep track of expensives, incomes and revenues. EyrisNotes seeks to aid the user in replacing his hard copy into a digital format that tracks and calculates the current amount owed or in profit for the user.

The app is also on the playstore
