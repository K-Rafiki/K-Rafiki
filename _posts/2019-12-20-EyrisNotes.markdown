There comes a point in every student's life when he or she desires to be tutored to understand difficult concepts, and it is no surprise that there are dozens of such academies in every city, however there is still no method to compare them in terms of cost, courses offered and even quality. 

The executives and teachers of such academies face a hard time communicating in communicating with students. Whether its holiday tomorrow or a quiz, a missing element is communicating these facts to the students. This app features academy driven communicating, between teachers and their respective students and practice tests created by teachers. Students can also see their respective timetables of the academy timings posted by the admin. 

The app extensively uses local SQLite storage, so that lack of internet is never an issue, whether its practicing your tests, looking at the timetable or  simply keeping up with the noticeboard.
