E-Commerce platforms have threatened the presence of local stores and millions of jobs. Because many of the local stores cannot afford to run their own online website and/or digitize their business, the flourishing E-Commerce giants enjoy a large market share. This project aims to solve the problem by providing an opportunity to the local stores to digitize their business and manage an online presence in their local community in the most accessible way possible, an android application. This Project intends to help the small-to-mid sized retail stores by providing them an online presence, as well as aid the customers to search and roam for products offered by retailers in their city online. The structure is a Research Online, Purchase Offline (ROPO) which will have an immense positive impact for the locality by discouraging the online oligopolies from raking the profits as well as save many businesses. 


## Background
With the genesis of the Internet and the modern approaches to business, that is the economy of scale and variety, selling cheap goods and keeping all the variety only the large stores with online presence survived. Coupled with the internet, websites and mobile applications reduce the initial costs of business to a fraction as compared to the infrastructure costs of a building. Big online retailers and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, daraz, aliExpress etc threaten the small offline local retailers and their many million jobs and businesses.
