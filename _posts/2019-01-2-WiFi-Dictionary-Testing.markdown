This app is to test the strength of a WiFi password. There are many common passwords across communities, and many have gathered together a list of such passwords called dictionaries. If you are someone who wishes to test your WiFi's strength to some dictionaries, the WiFi Dictionary tester can help.

It can scan the nearby WiFi Access Points, download dictionaries from local storage, attempt the passwords one by one automatically after selecting a WiFi to test.
