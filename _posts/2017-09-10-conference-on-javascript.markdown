This was a small project to help my cousin. He had a large excel column of phone numbers and needed to send all of them a message, however, at the time, he could only do so by manually entering all of the numbers one by one into a text message. Thus I made an app to aid in such circumstances.

A CSV file can be uploaded to the app from the local storage that contains a list of phone number. Then a Message can be written and sent to all of the numbers.
